## 🧠 Introduction
Our project is a web and Discord-based mental health platform designed to make therapy and emotional support more accessible, personalized, and stigma-free—especially for Gen Z, young adults, and students.
<br>
It offers:<br>
ML-powered therapist matching to connect users with the right professionals based on their needs,<br>
Anonymous peer support chatrooms,<br>
Real-time therapy sessions via secure Discord channels,<br>
<br>
We’re building a space where users not only get help—but get the right kind of help. In a time where mental health struggles are rising, especially among youth, our platform fills the gap between professional care and community support, right where the users already are—on the web and on Discord.

## ❗ Problem Statement
<br>
We’re addressing the growing mental health crisis, especially among Gen Z and young adults, where access to the right support is limited, confusing, or stigmatized.<br>

Key pain points include:<br>
Difficulty in finding the right therapist—most people don’t know there are specializations in therapy.<br>
Low awareness and high stigma around mental health, especially in college and early career environments.<br>
Lack of continuous support—users need not just one-time sessions, but a mix of professional guidance and community connection.<br>
Traditional platforms are expensive, isolating, or not Gen Z-friendly.<br>
This matters because mental health struggles are rising fast—data from our presentation shows a sharp increase in distress among young people, and existing systems aren’t built to support them in the ways they prefer to engage.<br>
Our platform solves this by combining smart therapist matching, anonymous peer communities, and Discord-based support, making mental health care personal, approachable, and built for the digital-native generation.
